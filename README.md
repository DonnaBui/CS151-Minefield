This is a simple Minefield game made for Professor John Pearce's CS151 at SJSU. 

It's based on Minesweeper, but instead of clicking on tiles, you have to move your character across the field and avoid stepping on mines using the built-in directional controls.

This project utilizes the MVC framework which consists of Model, View, Command, AppFactory, AppPanel, and other supplementary classes. Our Minefield game utilizes extensions of these classes.
